# Quick Summary
This project is about classifying the activity of a vessel based on sequence of vessel position and a few vessel data.

# Main Components
There are three main components in this project
1. Data Preparation
2. Model Training
3. Simulation

# Data Preparation
Data preparation is related to data cleaning and data transformation.


# Model Training
This component also consists of few tranformation which is related to data aggregation and calculation of some ....

# Simulation
In this component, the process will simulate how to use a trained machine learning model.
